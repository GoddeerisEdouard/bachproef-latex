  abstract  = {Twitter is one of the most popular information source available on the Web. Thus, there exist many studies focused on analyzing the credibility of the shared information. Most proposals use either Twitter API or web scraping to extract the data to perform such analysis. Both extraction techniques have advantages and disadvantages. In this work, we present a study to evaluate their performance and behavior. The motivation for this research comes from the necessity to know ways to extract online information in order to analyze in real-time the credibility of the content posted on the Web. To do so, we develop a framework which offers both alternatives of data extraction and implements a previously proposed credibility model. Our framework is implemented as a Google Chrome extension able to analyze tweets in real-time. Results report that both methods produce identical credibility values, when a robust normalization process is applied to the text (i.e., tweet). Moreover, concerning the time performance, web scraping is faster than Twitter API, and it is more flexible in terms of obtaining data; however, web scraping is very sensitive to website changes.},

  abstract  = {This paper views the typical insurance arrangement as a transfer mechanism. In addition to the primary "risk transfer" by which insurance systems can be distinguished from other financial systems, the paper identifies three secondary transfers and four other transfers that the author views as associated with insurance but incidental to it. The paper then analyzes four different insurance systems in accordance with the transfers that take place within such system, and the relative importance of each to the particular system examined. The insurance systems subjected to this analysis are (1) automobile liability insurance, (2) group medical expense insurance, (3) the private pension plan, and (4) the OASDI social insurance system.},
